# Detecting_Ripe_unRipe_tomatos
This project uses popular machine learning models:

**CNN**,
**vgg16**, **resnet50** and a custom model named **tomato_model**

to detect if a tomato is Riped or unrRiped.

This project also contains saved weight of pretrained models which you can just load and test it in real time using IP-webcam.
